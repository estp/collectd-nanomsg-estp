=====================================
Collectd Plugin for ESTP over nanomsg
=====================================

The ESTP is Extensible Statistics Transmission Protocol. The protocol is
intended to become standard protocol for submission statistics data by nanomsg
applications. More info can be found here:

http://github.com/estp/estp

The plugin allows both to receive data from nanomsg for storing by collectd
and to publish collectd-provided statistics to nanomsg socket. So it's capable
to send data between collectd instances too


Building
========

The following is a basic build process::

    git submodule update --init
    make
    sudo make install

Note: the build process clones full collectd repository and runs "configure" on
it. You can ignore the whole configure output, as nothing except header files
are used from collectd itself. If there is better way to build collectd plugin
please send pull requests.


Configuration
=============

The following is example config, which accepts data::

    LoadPlugin nanomsg_estp
    <Plugin "nanomsg_estp">
      <Socket Subscribe>
        Bind "tcp://*:6001"
      </Socket>
    </Plugin>

Any nanomsg address can be specified for ``Bind``.

The following is example config, which sends data from collectd to another
collectd instance or any other processing application::

    LoadPlugin nanomsg_estp
    <Plugin "nanomsg_estp">
      <Socket Publish>
        Connect "tcp://host.example.com:6001"
      </Socket>
    </Plugin>

Note: if you have write filters enabled, do not forget to add "nanomsg_estp"
plugin to your "write" target.

The ``Connect`` and ``Bind`` directives both can be used in any socket types,
and can be used multiple times. ``Pull`` socket can be used instead
``Subscribe``, likewise ``Push`` socket can be used instead ``Publish``.
However, this is rarely useful in practice. For more information refer to
nanomsg documentation.


Command-line
============

If you want to play with plugin from a command-line, it's possible both to
submit data to collectd, and receive data from it.

First, let's prepare config::

    LoadPlugin nanomsg_estp
    <Plugin "nanomsg_estp">
      <Socket Subscribe>
        Bind "tcp://127.0.0.1:6001"
      </Socket>
      <Socket Publish>
        Bind "tcp://127.0.0.1:6002"
      </Socket>
    </Plugin>
    <Chain "PostCache">
        Target "write"
    </Chain>

Then you can send data using the following command-line::

    nanocat --pub --connect tcp://127.0.0.1:6001 --delay=0.2 --data="ESTP:localhost:myapp:instance1:value: $(TZ=UTC date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") 10 100"

I assume that you on unix and have ``date`` utility. On Windows you may need
to write date yourself. When submitting by hand, you may use shorter form::

    nn_pub -l6001 -d0.2 -D"ESTP:localhost:myapp:instance1:value: $(TZ=UTC date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") 10 100"

See the ESTP spec for the description of the data format. To read
the data use the following::

    nanocat --sub --connect tcp://127.0.0.1:6002 --format=ascii

This will show both the data sent from other nanomsg clients to collectd, and
the data produced by collectd itself. As well as you can connect to any
nanomsg client directly without collectd intermediary. Shorter form::

    nn_sub -Al6002

You may filter values. To filter values from localhost only::

    nn_sub -Al6002 --subscribe "ESTP:localhost:"

Note: that if you use ``--format=ascii`` or ``--ascii`` or ``-A`` option, you
will see ESTP extensions garbled (e.g. many messages generated by collectd
itself do have extension that stores collectd-specific info).
You may use ``--format=quoted`` to have them correctly escaped.
